# HARNESS.md — The harness, explained

> One-stop explainer for *what holds this project together for AI agents*. Read this once when joining the repo. Update it when the harness itself changes (not when features change — that's `.brain/features/`).

## What is the harness?

The **harness** is the system *around* the LLM that makes coding agents reliable across sessions. It is not the model, the prompt, or the codebase — it is the scaffolding that keeps agents from forgetting context, drifting from conventions, breaking unrelated code, or stopping at "compiles but wrong."

This repo follows the **5-subsystem framework** from [walkinglabs/learn-harness-engineering](https://github.com/walkinglabs/learn-harness-engineering/tree/main/skills/harness-creator):

```
1. Instructions   →  what to read before working
2. State          →  what's done, in progress, where I left off
3. Verification   →  how to prove a change is correct
4. Scope          →  what counts as "this task" (and what doesn't)
5. Lifecycle      →  bootstrap, session handoff, clean restart
```

Every concrete artifact below maps to one of those five.

## The interface: the brain-axi CLI

State, verification, and lifecycle are driven by the **[brain-axi](https://github.com/SeanningTatum/brain-axi) CLI** (`brain`) rather than by hand-editing files. The CLI reads/writes `.brain/` and emits token-efficient TOON with a `help[]` block on every command, so an agent self-bootstraps.

- **Orient:** `brain` · `brain progress` · `brain features`
- **Look up:** `brain docs <section>` · `brain docs view <sec/file>` · `brain search "<q>"` · `brain features view <slug>`
- **Record:** `brain progress add …` · `brain runs append <slug> …` · `brain features set-status <slug> …` · `brain ship <slug> --evidence …`
- **Verify:** `brain check` (brain-state invariants) — wrapped by [`scripts/harness-check.sh`](../scripts/harness-check.sh) which adds repo-only checks
- **Playbooks:** `brain playbook plan|verify|execute`
- **Setup:** `brain setup --app claude` (session-start context hook)

Install: `npx skills add SeanningTatum/brain-axi --skill brain`. The slash commands, `init.sh`, and `scripts/harness-check.sh` are **thin repo-specific wrappers** on top of the CLI — they add bun/CF steps (baseline, typecheck, e2e, feature-verify) the generic CLI does not own. Prefer `brain` over reading raw files.

## 1. Instructions — Recipe Shelf

The agent's reading list. Layered from generic to specific.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`/CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) + [`/AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) | Brain pointer at repo root. Mirrored. Lists 5 non-negotiables, scope policy, brain layout. |
| [`.brain/codebase/`](codebase/) | Programming model — Effect TS, helpers, testing patterns, tRPC API surface, i18n |
| [`.brain/high-level-architecture/`](high-level-architecture/) | Macro view — system layers, data flow, security, integrations, user journeys |
| [`.brain/rules/`](rules/) | 7 layer-aligned do/don't rules — frontend, cloudflare, repository, services, routes, library, errors. Auto-surfaced per edited path by [`rule-router.sh`](../.claude/hooks/rule-router.sh) (see Lifecycle) |
| [`.brain/recipes/`](recipes/) | 8 deterministic step-by-step runbooks — bookended by `00-before-task.md` and `99-verify-done.md` |
| [`.brain/features/`](features/) | One MD per shipped/in-progress feature (purpose, runtime flow, key files, changelog) |

**Reading rule**: *retrieval over recall*. Open the matching `index.md` first; it tells you which file(s) apply. Do not rely on training data for project patterns.

---

## 2. State — Prep Station

What is true *right now*.

| File | Purpose | CLI access |
|------|---------|------------|
| [`features/feature_list.json`](features/feature_list.json) | Machine-readable feature status, dependencies, evidence. Source of truth for "what's in flight." | read: `brain features` / `brain features view <slug>`; write: `brain features set-status <slug> …` / `brain ship <slug> …` |
| [`runs/progress.md`](runs/progress.md) | Rolling session cursor — newest entry on top, ≤5 lines per checkpoint. Read at session start. | read: `brain progress`; write: `brain progress add --summary … --next …` |
| [`runs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`](runs/) | Per-task deep state — baselines, dead ends, decisions, verbatim test output | read: `brain runs` / `brain runs view <name>`; write: `brain runs append <slug> --step … --observed …` |
| [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) | High-level architectural / brain shifts (NOT code changelog — `git log` is) | On architectural change |
| `features/<slug>/<slug>.md` "Changelog" table | Per-feature behaviour changes | On every behavior change to feature |

**Two-layer rule**: `progress.md` is "where am I right now"; `runs/<slug>.md` is "everything I learned doing this task." First is read at session start, second when continuing a specific task.

---

## 3. Verification — Quality Check Window

Externalises "am I done?" so the agent does not declare victory on a half-built feature.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`recipes/99-verify-done.md`](recipes/99-verify-done.md) | Full checklist: **tests that pin the change** (if source touched, via `test-author`) → typecheck → test → **e2e smoke (default ON)** → build (if CF-touching) → **feature verification** (if UI, via `feature-verifier`) → harness-check → brain coherence |
| [`features/<slug>/verifications/`](features/index.md) | Browser-walk evidence per feature (screenshots + verdict), produced by the `feature-verifier` sub-agent — the feature-level proof layer, co-located in each feature's folder |
| [`/verify-done`](../.claude/commands/verify-done.md) slash command | Same checklist, runnable mid-conversation |
| [`init.sh --baseline`](../init.sh) | Captures pre-change baseline (typecheck + test + harness-check) so post-change failures aren't blamed on you |
| `brain check` | brain-axi's deterministic brain-state invariants: feature_list parses, ≤1 in-progress, feature doc paths, dependency refs, progress.md, plan/review integrity, verification Verdict lines. The authoritative state gate. |
| [`scripts/harness-check.sh`](../scripts/harness-check.sh) | Wraps `brain check`, then adds repo-only invariants brain-axi does not own: HARNESS.md exists, init.sh executable, CLAUDE↔AGENTS sync, sub-agent frontmatter, core recipes, dead internal links, every `settings.json` hook script exists + is executable, and both hook mapping test suites pass ([`test-rule-router.sh`](../scripts/test-rule-router.sh), [`test-brain-reminder.sh`](../scripts/test-brain-reminder.sh)). Run by `init.sh` + CI. |
| [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | CI gate mirroring `init.sh` baseline + `build` + `e2e` smoke specs + non-negotiables grep sweep on every PR |
| [`.claude/hooks/brain-reminder.sh`](../.claude/hooks/brain-reminder.sh) | Pre-commit hook listing brain docs the staged paths likely affect (deterministic, no LLM, never blocks — CI is the gate) |
| [`.claude/hooks/rule-router.sh`](../.claude/hooks/rule-router.sh) | Pre-edit hook injecting the [`rules/`](rules/) layer doc for the touched path — moves "did you read the rule?" off agent discipline (deterministic, no LLM, never blocks) |
| [`app/lib/effect-trpc.ts`](../app/lib/effect-trpc.ts) `appErrorToTRPC` | Compile-time exhaustiveness on tagged-error → HTTP code via `assertNever`. New tagged error w/o case = TS error. |

**Verification rule**: green typecheck + green tests is *necessary, not sufficient* — and a green suite that never exercised the change proves nothing, which is why `test-author` runs first (`99-verify-done.md` §1). UI features need a `feature-verifier` browser walk with a PASS verdict doc. CF-binding changes need `bun run build`. E2E smoke specs are default-on (opt-out only with run-note justification — see `99-verify-done.md` §3). Skipping is the single biggest source of premature "done."

---

## 4. Scope — Task Boundaries

What counts as "this task" — and what doesn't.

- **One in-progress feature at a time.** Source: `feature_list.json` `status: "in-progress"` count must be 1.
- **Definition of done** (per CLAUDE.md): impl complete + `/verify-done` green + feature MD updated + `feature_list.json` flipped + run note closed.
- **Cross-feature touch limit**: ≤2 features per diff. More than that = split into separate tasks with separate run notes.
- **Anti-creep heuristic**: if you find yourself "while I'm here…" cleaning up code unrelated to the diff, stop. Open a new task.

---

## 5. Lifecycle — Session Management

Bootstrap, handoff, recovery.

| Step | Tool |
|------|------|
| Session start | SessionStart hook injects `brain context` (live brain state) + harness pointers ([`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`](../.claude/hooks/session-start.sh)); install the canonical brain-axi hook with `brain setup --app claude` |
| Project bootstrap | [`./init.sh`](../init.sh) — install + typegen + migrate + typecheck + test |
| Baseline before edit | [`./init.sh --baseline`](../init.sh) — capture green state |
| Task framing | `/start-task` ([`commands/start-task.md`](../.claude/commands/start-task.md)) — runs baseline, reads brain, opens run note, writes progress entry |
| Mid-task checkpoint | `brain progress add --summary … --next …` (appends to [`runs/progress.md`](runs/progress.md)) |
| Task done | `/verify-done` ([`commands/verify-done.md`](../.claude/commands/verify-done.md)) — full checklist |
| Ship a feature | `/ship-feature` ([`commands/ship-feature.md`](../.claude/commands/ship-feature.md)) — verify-done + `brain ship <slug> --evidence` (flips `feature_list.json`, checkpoints, runs `brain check`) + update feature MD + close run note |
| Validate harness | `/harness-check` ([`commands/harness-check.md`](../.claude/commands/harness-check.md)) — runs [`scripts/harness-check.sh`](../scripts/harness-check.sh) = `brain check` + repo supplement |
| Before an edit | [`rule-router.sh`](../.claude/hooks/rule-router.sh) — `PreToolUse(Edit\|Write\|NotebookEdit)` hook maps the edited path to its [`rules/`](rules/) layer doc and injects the pointer (once per layer per session). Globs mirror the table in [`rules/index.md`](rules/index.md) |
| Pre-commit | [`brain-reminder.sh`](../.claude/hooks/brain-reminder.sh) hook lists brain files to update |
| Architectural shift | Append to [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) |

### Slash command surface

```
/start-task    → kickoff (baseline + brain read + framing + run note + progress entry)
/verify-done   → full verification checklist
/ship-feature  → close out an in-progress feature
/harness-check → validate harness invariants (brain state, sync, sub-agents, files, deps, dead-links, hook wiring + hook tests)
```

`/harness-check` is the single deterministic gate — runs in seconds, no LLM, exits non-zero on any drift.

---

## Sub-agents — specialised harness operators

Custom subagents in [`.claude/agents/`](../.claude/agents/) wrap pieces of the harness so the main thread can delegate without re-loading rules.

| Agent | Use when |
|-------|----------|
| `brain-navigator` | Read-only locator. Returns "what to read for X task" by walking the brain indexes. |
| `effect-ts-enforcer` | Reviews a diff for the 5 non-negotiables (no `throw`, no Zod, tagged errors mapped, repo/service patterns, no `process.env`). |
| `test-author` | Writes the unit tests that pin a change (`99-verify-done.md` §1). Every test must name the regression it catches; prunes redundant ones. Writes to `**/__tests__/**` only. Runs `opus` — picking which tests are worth writing is judgment work. |
| `verify-done-runner` | Runs the full `99-verify-done.md` checklist and reports pass/fail per step. |
| `feature-verifier` | Drives a feature's golden + error path through the live app with the Playwright CLI (throwaway headless script run via `bun`), screenshots each step, writes a verdict doc to `verifications/`. The feature-level proof layer. |
| `feature-tracker` | Updates `feature_list.json` + `features/<slug>/<slug>.md` on status change. Refuses to touch code. |
| `recipe-runner` | Executes one of the 8 `add-*` recipes deterministically. Inputs: recipe name + task params. |

See [`.claude/agents/README.md`](../.claude/agents/README.md) for invocation syntax and full descriptions. Plugin-provided agents (`feature-dev`, `code-review`, `frontend-design`, etc.) are documented in their respective plugin READMEs and are *complementary* to these harness-specific ones.

---

## Five non-negotiables (recap from CLAUDE.md)

1. **Effect TS** is the default. No `throw`, no `try/catch` outside `Effect.tryPromise`.
2. **Effect Schema** for all validation. **No Zod.**
3. **Tagged errors** in `app/models/errors/`. Map in `app/lib/effect-trpc.ts`.
4. **Unit test for every helper and repository.**
5. **Cloudflare Workers, not Node.** Bindings via `CloudflareEnv` Tag. Never `process.env`.

Full detail: [`codebase/effect-ts.md`](codebase/effect-ts.md).

## When you change the harness itself

Editing this file, `init.sh`, hooks, sub-agents, or `feature_list.json` schema → append a row to [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) under "Brain / harness shifts." Bump the date in [`features/feature_list.json`](features/feature_list.json) `updated` field.
